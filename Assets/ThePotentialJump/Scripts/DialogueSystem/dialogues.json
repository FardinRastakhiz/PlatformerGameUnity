Every energy saved inside the material is called potential energy, like gravitational potential energy. Also, we can save energy as elastic potential energy, electrical energy, and magnetic energy. For example, spring and rubber both are elastic and can save energy as elastic energy. So let’s save the energy inside spring.",

But with some reactions like burning, they release the potential energy and go to the simpler form with lower potential energy, like rocket fuels. All released energy together are huge, and if we orient that, we can make the required kinetic energy to reach Moon.",
